- 👋 Hi, I’m @Teltondor
- 👀 I’m interested in growing my skills in web and application design. In particular, I have a background in graphic design and so eventually look to get into UI, UX.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Python to start off with and form a strong foundation in understanding coding
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could be within my (at least so far) somewhat limited skillset :)
