- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Teltondor
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in growing my skills in web and application design. In particular, I have a background in graphic design and so eventually look to get into UI, UX.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of Python to start off with and form a strong foundation in understanding coding, while starting to dip my toes into HTML, CSS and integrating them all with Flask.
